        <p> LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds
        of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters </p>
        <p>According to the report, sections of the document &mdash;"almost invariably the most crucial passages"&mdash; are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read,
        due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
        <p>CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> the Cold War </li>
            <li> the civil-rights movement </li>
            <li> the growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
